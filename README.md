# Challenge Me!

![](z-climbing.jpg)

Finding ways to advance your programming skills is easier when you find a good resource. If you're looking for a place to start, check out these sites that offer exercises and other challenges you can participate in. Some are individual and others competitions; many can be started any time, while others happen at specific times of the year.

* [Sites that offer challenges](challenges.md), such as 100 Days of Code or Hacktoberfest.

* [Sites that offer exercises/contests](practice.md), such as Project Euler or Exercism.io.

* [Sites that offer exercises/contests](job-challenges.md), but who also work with companies to connect them with participants.<br>*(Note that these* aren't *a bad thing, and is probably a great way to monetize a site that has value for programmers too, but I'm placing them in their own area because they may be specifically what you're looking for... or trying to avoid!)*

Have a site to add, or notice something that needs fixed? [Contributions welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
