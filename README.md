Finding ways to challenge yourself, and to advance your programming skills, is easier when you find a good resource. If you're looking for a place to start, here are some sites that offer exercises and other challenges for you to participate in.

* Here's a [list of sites that offer practice problems](practice.md), on your own or in competition with others, such as Project Euler or Exercism.io.

* Here's a [list of sites that offer challenges](challenges.md), such as 100 Days of Code and Hacktoberfest.

Have a site to add, or notice something that needs fixed? [Contributions welcome](CONTRIBUTING.md)!
