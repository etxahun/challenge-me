Challenging yourself to constantly learn is tough. To help out, here's a list of challenges to participate in, some seasonal or on some scheduled basis, others any time you want.

# Anytime

## 100 Days Of Code

**Learn more:** [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)

Commit to writing code, an hour a day for 100 days. Whenever you choose to start is Day 1. Tweet about it, share it, post it on GitHub, inspire others to do the same.

In keeping with the spirit of the original intent, if your day job is programming then it shouldn't be "work stuff".
