Challenging yourself to constantly learn is tough. To help out, here's a list of challenges to participate in, some seasonal or on some scheduled basis, others any time you want.

When looking for an opensource project to help out with for some of the challenges below, check out these sites: [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/), [CodeMontage](http://codemontage.com/), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/), [issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/)

# Anytime

## 100 Days Of Code

**Learn more:** [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)

Commit to writing code, an hour a day for 100 days. Whenever you choose to start is Day 1. Tweet about it, share it, post it on GitHub, inspire others to do the same.

In keeping with the spirit of the original intent, if your day job is programming then it shouldn't be "work stuff".

# Time of Year

## October

### Hacktoberfest

**Learn more:** [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

DigitalOcean and GitHub team up to challenge everyone to contribute to open source throughout the month. Register on the site and find an opensource project to contribute to. At the end of the month, they run a report to see who has created at least four pull-requests and send out t-shirts and stickers to everyone who did.

## December

### 24 Pull Requests

**Learn more:** [24 Pull Requests: Giving back little gifts of code for Christmas](https://24pullrequests.com/)

People are encouraged - on their own, or by forming teams or organizing meetups - to contribute to opensource during the 24 days leading up to Christmas. I guess that means a goal of one PR a day... pretty ambitious!

# Periodically

## Ludum Dare
