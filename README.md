Challenging yourself to constantly learn is tough. To help out, here's a list of challenges to participate in, some seasonal or on some scheduled basis, others any time you want. *([Have a site to add](CONTRIBUTING.md)?)*

When looking for an opensource project to help out with for some of the challenges below, check out these sites: [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/), [CodeMontage](http://codemontage.com/), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/), [issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/)

# Anytime

## 100 Days Of Code

Commit to writing code, an hour a day for 100 days. Whenever you choose to start is Day 1. Tweet about it, share it, post it on GitHub, inspire others to do the same.

In keeping with the spirit of the original intent, if your day job is programming then it shouldn't be "work stuff".

## Exercism

Complete a set of exercises in the language of your choice. You work on each exercise one at a time, and you're provided with the test suite that (when all the tests pass) proves your solution is doing what it should do.

# Time of Year

## October

### Hacktoberfest

**When?** All October

DigitalOcean and GitHub team up to challenge everyone to contribute to open source throughout the month. Register on the site and find an opensource project to contribute to. At the end of the month, they run a report to see who has created at least four pull-requests and send out t-shirts and stickers to everyone who did.

## December

### 24 Pull Requests

**When?** All December

People are encouraged - on their own, or by forming teams or organizing meetups - to contribute to opensource during the 24 days leading up to Christmas. I guess that means a goal of one PR a day... pretty ambitious!
