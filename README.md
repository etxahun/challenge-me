Challenging yourself to constantly learn is tough. To help out, here's a list of challenges to participate in, some seasonal or on some scheduled basis, others any time you want. *([Have a site to add](CONTRIBUTING.md)?)*

When looking for an opensource project to help out with for some of the challenges below, check out these sites: [Up For Grabs](http://up-for-grabs.net/), [CodeMontage](http://codemontage.com/), [CodeTriage](https://www.codetriage.com/), [issuehub.io](http://issuehub.io/)

# Anytime

## 100 Days Of Code

**Learn more:** [Join the #100DaysOfCode](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/join-the-100daysofcode-556ddb4579e4)

Commit to writing code, an hour a day for 100 days. Whenever you choose to start is Day 1. Tweet about it, share it, post it on GitHub, inspire others to do the same.

In keeping with the spirit of the original intent, if your day job is programming then it shouldn't be "work stuff".

## 99 Problems

**Learn more:** *Well...*

This one is a bit different. Werner Hett created 99 problems to help people learn Prolog. It was then ported to several other languages.

* [P-99: Ninety-Nine Prolog Problems](https://sites.google.com/site/prologsite/prolog-problems)
* [L-99: Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
* [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

## CodeKata

**Learn more:** [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-intro/)

You can find code katas all over the web, but the owner of this particular site laid out some in such a way 

## Codewars

**Learn more:** [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

As near I can tell, anyone can sign up and either complete code katas in a given language, or create code katas for others to complete.

## CodinGame

**Learn more:** [Contest Rules](https://www.codingame.com/rules)

Complete different puzzles in multiple languages, either on your own or competing against others. *(Note that it's also a recruiting platform, where companies can find people with the skills they're looking for.)*

## Exercism

**Learn more:** How it Works: For [New Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie) / For [Experienced Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works)

Complete a set of exercises in the language of your choice. You work on each exercise one at a time, and you're provided with the test suite that (when all the tests pass) proves your solution is doing what it should do.

## Project Euler

**Learn more:** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." ~ [source](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Ruby Quiz

**Learn more:** [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/)

Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers, although the site is an archival site. Still, there are over 150 challenges on it, and I don't see any reason you'd *have* to solve them in Ruby, if you wanted to try a different language.

# Time of Year

## October

### Hacktoberfest

**Learn more:** [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/)

**When is it?** All October

DigitalOcean and GitHub team up to challenge everyone to contribute to open source throughout the month. Register on the site and find an opensource project to contribute to. At the end of the month, they run a report to see who has created at least four pull-requests and send out t-shirts and stickers to everyone who did.

## December

### 24 Pull Requests

**Learn more:** [24 Pull Requests: Giving back little gifts of code for Christmas](https://24pullrequests.com/)

**When is it?** All December

People are encouraged - on their own, or by forming teams or organizing meetups - to contribute to opensource during the 24 days leading up to Christmas. I guess that means a goal of one PR a day... pretty ambitious!

# Periodically

## Ludum Dare

**Learn more:** [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/rules/)

**When is it?** *varies, see the site for details*

"Ludum Dare is an online community best known for “Ludum Dare”, the Accelerated Game Development Event of the same name (also called a “Game Jam”). During a Ludum Dare, developers from around the world spend a weekend creating games based on a theme suggested by the community. Ludum Dare events take place every April, August and December." ~ [source](http://ludumdare.com/compo/about-ludum-dare/)
