Following are sites which offer challenges or problems for programmers to work on and improve their skill.

## 99 Problems

**Learn more:** *Well...*

This one is a sort of a category. Werner Hett created 99 problems to help people learn Prolog. It was then ported to several other languages.

Online programming exercises, which you can complete in a variety of languages, and are offered in various levels of difficulty, some timed and some not.

## Codewars

As near I can tell, anyone can sign up and either complete code katas in a given language, or create code katas for others to complete.

## CodinGame

**Learn more:** [Contest Rules](https://www.codingame.com/rules)

Complete different puzzles in multiple languages, either on your own or competing against others. *(Note that it's also a recruiting platform, where companies can find people with the skills they're looking for.)*

## DailyProgrammer Subreddit

**Learn more:** [DailyProgrammer](https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/)

Problems are posted several times per week, and vary in complexity between easy, intermediate and hard. Then you can respond under each thread with your questions or solutions.

## Exercism

**Learn more:** How it Works: For [New Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie) / For [Experienced Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works)

Complete a set of exercises in the language of your choice. You work on each exercise one at a time, and you're provided with the test suite that (when all the tests pass) proves your solution is doing what it should do.

## HackerEarth

**Learn more:** [Programming Tutorials and Practice Problems](https://www.hackerearth.com/practice/)

Sign up to complete various programming exercises. As far as I understand it, companies can try to recruit people based on the skills they show in completing exercises.

## HackerRank

**Learn more:** [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/aboutus)

Similar to HackerEarth, they provide different programming exercises, and companies can try to recruit those who show aptitude in whatever skills they're looking for.

## LeetCode

**Learn more:** [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/faq/)

They provide hundreds of exercises that you can complete in various languages, and then submit for grading. Looks like they save your answers too. Apparently interviewers can use the site for assessing an interviewee's technical skills, but it looks like anyone can use it. They also have [weekly challenges](https://leetcode.com/contest/).

## Programming Praxis

**Learn more:** [Programming Praxis: Sharpen your saw](https://programmingpraxis.com/contents/about/)

"The programming exercises provided here aren't a contest. No points are awarded, no scores are kept, there is no list of readers who have completed all the exercises. If you complete the exercise, and perhaps in doing so learn something that will help you be a better programmer, then your effort is its own reward."

A collection of about 500 exercises that you can complete in any language.

## Programmr

**Learn more:** [Programmr: Programmer's Playground](http://www.programmr.com/about_us)

"Programmr is an online interactive lab for students and enthusiasts to learn, practice and become proficient in programming."

## Project Euler

**Learn more:** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems."

## Python Challenge

**Learn more:** [About Python Challenge](http://www.pythonchallenge.com/about.php)

A series of levels (33 so far), to be solved one at a time. The site says Python, but I checked out a few and they're general enough that any programming language could be used.

## Ruby Quiz

**Learn more:** [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/)

Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers, although the site is an archival site. Still, there are over 150 challenges on it, and I don't see any reason you'd *have* to solve them in Ruby, if you wanted to try a different language.

## Timus Online Judge

**Learn more:** [Timus Online Judge](http://acm.timus.ru/help.aspx?topic=judge)

A collection of over 1000 problems of varying difficulty from contests at various universities and championships. You can complete them in any language, and then submit your solution for automatically judging by the system.
