Following are sites which offer challenges or problems for programmers to work on and improve their skill.

## 99 Problems

**Learn more:** *Well...*

This one is a bit different. Werner Hett created 99 problems to help people learn Prolog. It was then ported to several other languages.

* [L-99: Ninety-Nine Lisp Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)
* [H-99: Ninety-Nine Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)

## CodeKata

**Learn more:** [CodeKata](http://codekata.com/kata/codekata-intro/)

You can find code katas all over the web, but the owner of this particular site laid out some in such a way 

## Codewars

**Learn more:** [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/)

As near I can tell, anyone can sign up and either complete code katas in a given language, or create code katas for others to complete.

## CodinGame

**Learn more:** [Contest Rules](https://www.codingame.com/rules)

Complete different puzzles in multiple languages, either on your own or competing against others. *(Note that it's also a recruiting platform, where companies can find people with the skills they're looking for.)*

## Exercism

**Learn more:** How it Works: For [New Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works/newbie) / For [Experienced Developers](http://exercism.io/how-it-works)

Complete a set of exercises in the language of your choice. You work on each exercise one at a time, and you're provided with the test suite that (when all the tests pass) proves your solution is doing what it should do.

## Project Euler

**Learn more:** [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/)

"Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical insights to solve. Although mathematics will help you arrive at elegant and efficient methods, the use of a computer and programming skills will be required to solve most problems." ~ [source](https://projecteuler.net/)

## Ruby Quiz

**Learn more:** [Ruby Quiz](http://rubyquiz.com/)

Ruby Quiz is a weekly programming challenge for Ruby programmers, although the site is an archival site. Still, there are over 150 challenges on it, and I don't see any reason you'd *have* to solve them in Ruby, if you wanted to try a different language.
