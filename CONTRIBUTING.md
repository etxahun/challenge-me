If you'd like to submit a site, great!

Just fork this repo and create a pull request containing three things:

1. the name
2. a link to learn more, and
3. a brief description

Insert it wherever seems appropriate. (i.e. specific dates, periodically, anytime, or something new)

> ## Name of Challenge

> **Learn more:** [Some Link](http://example.com/)

> Brief explanation of the purpose of the challenge/contest.

Here's some markdown you can copy if that makes it easier:

```
## Name of Challenge

**Learn more:** [Some Link](http://example.com/)

Brief explanation of the purpose of the challenge/contest.
```
